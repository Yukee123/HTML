		League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.
	</p>
	<p>
		League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively. The negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an upcoming animated series. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version and a digital collectible card game. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the property is in development.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene composed of 12 leagues. The domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, as well as cable television sports channel ESPN.

	<br> 
		League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective.[3][4] As of April 2021, there are 155 champions available to play.[5] Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies.[6] Items also increase champions' strength,[7] and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions,[3] champions, or defensive structures.[6][7] In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team's base.[3] Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.

<br>
		Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play.[9][10][11] The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.[12][a]
	</p>
	<p>
		Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as "turrets".[14] Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game or reappear after death.[14] Non-player characters known as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.[15] Each team's base contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.[16] The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed.[17] Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.[18] These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.[19]	
	</p>
	<p>	
		Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.[20] Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom lane.[3][6][21] Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but with only one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players.[23][24] Given the small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.[25]
	</p>
	<p>
		Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2019 and made a permanent game mode the following month.[26][27] As with others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight automatically against opponents each round.[28] Teamfight Tactics is available for iOS and Android and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.[29]
	</p>
	<p>
		Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning with in-game events.[30][31] Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for two weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks.[32][33] A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout". The developer also said the costs associated with maintaining and balancing URF were too high.[34] Other temporary modes include One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all members of their team to play.[35][36] In Nexus Blitz, players participate in a series of mini-games on a compressed map

		Riot Games' founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients, known as DotA. A mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft III and install custom software; The Washington Post's Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and set up".[38] Phillip Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an expansion pack, then shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be supported over a significantly longer period.[39]
	</p>
	<p>
		Beck and Merill held a DotA tournament for students at the University of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There they met Jeff Jew, later a producer on League of Legends. Jew was very familiar with DotA and spent much of the tournament teaching others how to play. Beck and Merill invited him to an interview, and he joined Riot Games as an intern.[38] Beck and Merill recruited two figures involved with DotA: Steve Feak, one of its designers,[38] and Steve Mescon, who ran a support website to assist players.[40][41] Feak said early development was highly iterative, comparing it to designing DotA.[42]
	</p>
	<p>
		A demonstration of League of Legends built in the Warcraft III game engine was completed in four months and then shown at the 2007 Game Developers Conference.[39] There, Beck and Merill had little success with potential investors. Publishers were confused by the game's free-to-play business model and lack of a single-player mode. The free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian markets,[38] so publishers were primarily interested in a retail release, and the game's capacity for a sequel.[39] In 2008, Riot reached an agreement with holding company Tencent to oversee the game's launch in China.[39]
	</p>
	<p>
		League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008, for Microsoft Windows.[43][44] Closed beta-testing began in April 2009.[43][45] Upon the launch of the beta, seventeen champions were available.[46] Riot initially aimed to ship the game with 20 champions but doubled the number before the game's full release in North America on October 27, 2009.[47][48] The game's full name was announced as League of Legends: Clash of Fates. Riot planned to use the subtitle to signal when future content was available, but decided they were silly and dropped it before launch.

		</strong>
	<br>
		League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy dominated, League of Legends' patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch cadence to once approximately every two or three weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers creating audio for the game and its promotional materials.[50] As of 2021, the game has over 150 champions,[5] and Riot Games periodically overhauls the visuals and gameplay of the oldest in the roster.[51] Although only available for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available in March 2013.
